# UIKit-Swift

This project presents usage of elements from UIKit Framework.

No 3rd party libraries, no subclassing of UIControls, no big extensions. Just plain usage of visual controls provided by Apple, and testing how it looks after changing available properties.

### This project is written in two versions:

1) [UIKit-Storyboard](https://github.com/kamilgomolka/UIKit-Swift) : Views are created in Storybaoards / Xibs.
2) [UIKit-Swift](https://github.com/kamilgomolka/UIKit-Storyboard) : Views are created in code.

Besides the way of creating views, these two projects are more or less the same, although there might be some differences.  

### Supported Devices

* Deployment options are not limited - project can be ran on iPhone, iPad or Mac, and in all interface orientations. But I tested it mainly on iPhone in Portrait mode, so other devices/orientations might not be aligned properly.
* Dark mode is supported.

### Work in progress

The project is under development - more features are coming.
Howewer, I try to always commit working code, so please feel free to close repo & run it.
